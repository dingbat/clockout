Clockout v0.2
Usage:
        $ clock [options]

Options:
      --estimations, -e:   Show estimations made for first commit of each block
        --condensed, -c:   Condense output (don't show the timeline for each day)
   --generate-clock, -g:   Generate config file
             --help, -h:   Show this message

### General options ###

# Ignore initial commit, if it's just template/boilerplate
# - Default: false

#ignore_initial: true

# Minimum time between blocks of commits
# - Default: 120 min (change if you think some commits took you more than 2 hours)

#time_cutoff: 90


### Time-estimation options for each first commit of a timeblock ###

# Diffs of files matched by this regex will be included in commit time estimation.
# With some projects, there are diffs to binaries, images, files modified by an IDE, etc,
# that you don't want to report as your own work. Below is an example regex that will only
# calculate changes made to files with those extensions
# - Default:  /.*/ (matches everything)

#my_files: /\\.(m|h|txt)$/

# Diffs of files matched by this regex will NOT be included in commit time estimation
# You also have the option of defining a negative regex match, to ignore certain files.
# For example, if you added an external library or something, you should ignore it
# - Default:  <nothing>

#not_my_files: /SomeThirdPartyLibrary\\.*$/

# Estimation factor
# Use the -e option to see the estimations Clockout makes, and tweak them using this 
# value as necessary.
# - Default: 1.0

#estimation_factor: 0.9

# Put any override times for specific commits here (minutes). (You can use SHA1 hashes of any length)
# Note: keep a space before each hash for the YAML to parse properly.

#overrides:
# 48f63a7b: 90
# d354a31a: 30


### Clock-ins/-outs ###

# Do not modify these directly; use the `clock in` and `clock out` commands.
# See the readme for more details.
